# Monitoring

## What is Monitoring?

**Monitoring:** Collecting, analyzing, and using data to make decisions about IT resources and systems operational health

## Why Monitor?

### Proactive Problem Detection
- **Issue:** Users report slowdowns after they occur
- **Solution:** Detect problems before users notice
- **Benefit:** Maintain user satisfaction

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Challenge:** Users can't identify source of problems
- **Need:** Determine if issue is EC2, database, or code-related
- **Solution:** Comprehensive monitoring across all services

## Key Concepts

### Metrics vs Statistics
- **Metric:** Individual data point (e.g., current CPU utilization)
- **Statistics:** Metrics analyzed over time (e.g., average CPU over 24 hours)
- **Baseline:** Normal operational patterns used to detect anomalies

## Types of Metrics

### EC2 Metrics
- CPU utilization
- Network utilization
- Disk performance
- Memory utilization
- Status checks
- Application logs

### S3 Metrics
- Object storage size
- Number of objects
- HTTP request count

### RDS Metrics
- Database connections
- CPU utilization
- Disk space consumption

### Network Metrics
- VPC flow logs
- Traffic patterns
- Connection data

## Monitoring Benefits

### 1. Proactive Response
- **Detect issues** before users affected
- **Monitor key metrics** like error rates and latency
- **Prevent outages** through early intervention

### 2. Performance Improvement
- **Identify bottlenecks** in system architecture
- **Optimize resource usage** for better performance
- **Improve reliability** through data-driven insights

### 3. Security Enhancement
- **Establish baselines** for normal activity
- **Detect anomalies** like unusual traffic or IP addresses
- **Trigger alerts** for security events

### 4. Data-Driven Decisions
- **Track feature usage** and adoption
- **Measure business impact** of changes
- **Guide development priorities** with usage data

### 5. Cost Optimization
- **Identify underused resources** for rightsizing
- **Optimize spending** based on actual usage
- **Prevent overprovisioning** of resources
