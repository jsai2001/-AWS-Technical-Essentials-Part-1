# Choosing the Right Compute Service

## Decision Framework

Choose the right AWS compute service based on your specific use case requirements.

## Use Case Examples

### Use Case 1: Event-Driven Processing
**Scenario:** Upload inventory spreadsheet to S3 â†’ automatically load data into database (runs quarterly)

**Best Choice:** AWS Lambda
- **Why:** Pay only when code runs, S3 trigger integration, no idle costs
- **Alternative:** EC2 (works but costly for infrequent use)

### Use Case 2: Lift-and-Shift Migration
**Scenario:** Migrate existing Linux application from on-premises with minimal refactoring

**Best Choice:** Amazon EC2
- **Why:** Minimal code changes, Linux AMI support, familiar environment
- **Alternatives:** Lambda/Containers require significant refactoring

### Use Case 3: Microservices Architecture
**Scenario:** New application with microservices design, fast scaling, low deployment risk

**Best Choice:** Amazon ECS or EKS
- **Why:** Fast container startup, code portability, microservices support
- **Benefits:** Same container behavior across dev/test/prod environments

## Service Selection Guide

### AWS Lambda
**Best for:**
- Event-driven processing
- Infrequent workloads
- Serverless applications
- Short-duration tasks

### Amazon EC2
**Best for:**
- Lift-and-shift migrations
- Full OS control needed
- Long-running applications
- Custom configurations

### Container Services (ECS/EKS)
**Best for:**
- Microservices architecture
- Fast scaling requirements
- Code portability
- DevOps workflows

## Key Principles

1. **Match service to use case** - Don't use one service for everything
2. **Consider cost implications** - Pay model affects total cost
3. **Evaluate refactoring effort** - Balance migration complexity
4. **Think about scaling needs** - Different services scale differently
5. **Review existing workloads** - Reevaluate as AWS improves offerings
