# Choosing the Right Storage Service

## Decision Framework

Match storage service to specific use case requirements based on data characteristics and access patterns.

## Use Case Examples

### Use Case 1: Large Media Files (1-Year Retention)
**Scenario:** Store large media files accessed occasionally for one year

**Best Choice:** Amazon S3
- **Why:** Cost-effective for large files, durable, no provisioning needed
- **Alternatives:** EBS (expensive for large files), Instance Store (ephemeral)

### Use Case 2: MySQL Database Storage
**Scenario:** eCommerce database requiring fast, durable storage for orders/customers

**Best Choice:** Amazon EBS
- **Why:** Persistent, fast access, attached to compute, durable
- **Alternative:** Instance Store (fast but not durable for critical data)

### Use Case 3: Temporary Calculation Data
**Scenario:** Web app storing temporary data during calculations (speed + cost priority)

**Best Choice:** EC2 Instance Store
- **Why:** Included in EC2 price, fastest access, temporary data acceptable
- **Alternative:** EBS (more expensive, durability not needed)

### Use Case 4: WordPress Multi-Instance Setup
**Scenario:** Shared storage for WordPress installation across multiple instances

**Best Choice:** Amazon EFS
- **Why:** Shared file system, mountable on multiple instances
- **Alternative:** S3 (not a file system, can't mount)

## Storage Service Comparison

| Service | Type | Durability | Scalability | Attachment | Best For |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Instance Store** | Block | Ephemeral | Fixed | Built-in | Temporary, high-speed data |
| **EBS** | Block | Persistent | Provision-based | Single instance* | Databases, boot volumes |
| **S3** | Object | High | Unlimited | Network | Static content, backups |
| **EFS** | File | High | Auto-scaling | Multi-instance | Shared file systems |
| **FSx** | File | High | Managed | Multi-instance | Third-party file systems |

*Multi-attach available for specific volume types

## Key Characteristics

### Instance Store
- **Storage Type:** Block
- **Billing:** Included in EC2 price
- **Durability:** Ephemeral (lost on termination)
- **Use Cases:** Buffers, caches, scratch data

### EBS
- **Storage Type:** Block
- **Billing:** Pay for provisioned capacity
- **Durability:** Replicated within single AZ
- **Performance:** SSD (IOPS-based) or HDD (throughput-based)

### S3
- **Storage Type:** Object
- **Billing:** Pay for usage
- **Durability:** Multi-AZ replication
- **Access:** Not attached to compute

### EFS
- **Storage Type:** File
- **Billing:** Pay for usage
- **Durability:** Multi-AZ redundancy
- **Scalability:** Automatic (GB to PB)

### FSx
- **File Systems:** NetApp ONTAP, OpenZFS, Windows File Server, Lustre
- **Management:** Fully managed (provisioning, patching, backups)
- **Use Cases:** ML, analytics, HPC, media processing
