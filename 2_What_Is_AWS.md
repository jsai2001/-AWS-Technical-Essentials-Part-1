# What Is AWS?

## Cloud Computing Definition
**On-demand delivery of IT resources with primarily pay-as-you-go pricing**

## Deployment Models

### On-Premises
- Companies host and maintain their own hardware
- Requires dedicated infrastructure departments
- Costly operations limit workloads and experimentation
- High physical presence maintenance costs

### Cloud
- On-demand IT resource delivery over internet
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- No hardware/data center management required
- AWS owns and maintains data centers
- Provides virtual data center technologies

### Hybrid
- Connects cloud resources with existing on-premises infrastructure
- Extends organization's infrastructure into the cloud
- Bridges cloud-based and non-cloud resources

## On-Premises vs Cloud Comparison

### QA Environment Example
**On-Premises:**
- Buy and install hardware
- Connect cabling, provision power
- Install operating systems
- Time-consuming and expensive
- Delays time-to-market

**Cloud:**
- Replicate production environment in minutes/seconds
- Managed over internet
- No physical hardware installation

## Key Concept: "Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting"
- Focus on business-critical aspects (like code)
- Let AWS handle repetitive common tasks
- Remove tasks that don't differentiate your business
- Examples: Installing VMs, storing backups

## AWS Role
- Provides cloud computing services
- IT resources = AWS services
- Enables scalable, highly available, cost-effective infrastructure
- Quick application deployment without physical hardware management

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

### 1. Pay-as-You-Go
- Pay only for resources used
- No upfront data center/hardware investments

### 2. Massive Economies of Scale
- Lower costs through aggregated usage
- Hundreds of thousands of customers
- Higher economies of scale = lower prices

### 3. Stop Guessing Capacity
- No capacity planning guesswork
- Access needed capacity on-demand
- Scale up/down with minutes notice
- Avoid idle resources or capacity limitations

### 4. Increase Speed and Agility
- IT resources available with a click
- Reduce resource provisioning from weeks to minutes
- Lower cost and time for experimentation
- Dramatic organizational agility increase

### 5. Realize Cost Savings
- Focus on business-differentiating projects
- Remove "undifferentiated heavy lifting"
- Focus on customers vs. physical infrastructure

### 6. Go Global in Minutes
- Deploy applications in multiple regions with few clicks
- Lower latency for customers
- Better customer experience at minimal cost
